In this example, I created a simple example of a perceptron with one neuron and 2 inputs.

300 points are generated with random values on X and Y axes in a range from 0 to 300;

The canvas is split diagonally with a line.

All the points, that are above the line, are considered to be positive with a value of 1

All the points, that are below the line, are considered to be negative, with a value of -1

Now let's see of perceptron will be able to guess to which part of the canvas the point belongs.
